WARNING (Windows & OS X): When running the Linux-based MongoDB images on Windows and OS X, the file systems used to share between the host system and the Docker container is not compatible with the memory mapped files used by MongoDB (docs.mongodb.org and related jira.mongodb.org bug). This means that it is not possible to run a MongoDB container with the data directory mapped to the host. To persist data between container restarts, we recommend using a local named volume instead (see docker volume create). Alternatively you can use the Windows-based images on Windows.
